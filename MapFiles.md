How to map


# Details #

  * maps are in ascii format
  * like p = plains, m = mountains etc
  * you need to make a second file name map1.z (if the first file is map.1). This file will hold z axis information, ascii map with numbers (0 = underwater, 1 = basic height, 2 - 9 =   higher).
  * Z axis is not used for anything yet... so no need for it.
