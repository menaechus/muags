We aim to create a opensource morpg engine based on LibertyBasic and Cheetah Database System.

Current aim is creating the server and 2D capable client, but we are considering upgrading to a 3d client in the future.

We are currently looking for a few coders and perhaps someone capable creating graphics for the client

We are always open to new ideas, so please share them.

If you would like to be a part of this project please mail me: [markus.tolin@gmail.com]
