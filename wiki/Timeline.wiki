#summary Timeline for the project.

= Introduction =

This is here just to remind us on what to work on.


= Details =

Milestone 0.1
  * Working network code / _quite operational, perhaps ready for milestone_
  * Basic client - Create account, log in, log out, send and receive data / _create, log in, send and receive working, log out missing_
  * Basic server - Send and receive data, read data from files, require log in, handle accounts and characters / _very close to working, small work on the character handling (move,save,load) and it should be ready_
  * Chat / _working in theory, needs a gui, so we need to work on the client a bit more_
  * Player movement / _not implemented yet - perhaps we will leave the movement out from this milestone, just a basic view on the map so we will know that it works in theory_

Milestone 1.0
  * Optimizing network code
  * Client - create character, remove character, enter world, talk, move
  * Server - Receive and send coordinates, channel system, talking, whispering, save character
